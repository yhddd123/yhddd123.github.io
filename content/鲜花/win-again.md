### [Iran said to notify Qatar ahead of strike on US air base](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/iran-said-to-notify-qatar-ahead-of-strike-on-us-air-base)

Iran coordinated its attack on the US air base in Qatar with Qatari officials, according to the New York Times.

Tehran “gave advanced notice that attacks were coming to minimize casualties,” reports the newspaper, citing three Iranian officials with knowledge of the plans.

Iran desired to symbolically retaliate for the US strikes on its nuclear sites on Sunday, but also sought to ensure that both sides could easily deescalate, similar to a 2020 case when Iran notified Iraq before firing missiles at an American base in Iraq in response to the assassination of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, the officials say in the report.

The Trump administration was also made aware ahead of time that the attack would be taking place, a source familiar with the matter tells Axios.
